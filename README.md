# Tribute-Page

> This project took my five days but happy to see that I builded a fully responsive website.

> From this project I learned many new things.

> It's kinda a clone of wikipedia.

> I was just searching some project ideas on GFG(GeekforGeeks) and found a list of 10 projects in that the first one was a normal tribute page. So I thought why not making a tribute page for sir, A.P.J Abdul Kalam a great man of India known as missile man.

> Thanks to me that I completed it😊😎.
