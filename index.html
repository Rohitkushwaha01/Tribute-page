            <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </strong>(/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (audio speaker iconlisten); 15
                October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_India">president of India</a> from 2002 to 2007. He
                was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rameswaram">Rameswaram</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and studied <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics">Physics</a> and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering">arrospace engineering</a>. He spent the
                next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation">Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</a> and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Guided_Missile_Development_Programme">missile development efforts</a>.[1] He thus came
                to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
            </p>
            <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party">Bharatiya
                Janata Party</a> and the then-opposition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress">Indian National Congress</a>. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.</p>
            <p>While delivering a lecture at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Management_Shillong">Indian Institute of Management Shillong</a>, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rameswaram">Rameswaram</a>, where he was buried with full state
                honours.[8]</p>

            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
                Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
                Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been
                wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
                poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu
                and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved
                trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to
                the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
                businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral
                home.[19][20][21]
            </p>

            <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who
                had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After
                completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in
                Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was
                finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23] He narrowly missed
                achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
                positions were available in the IAF.[24]

            <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working
                under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch
                Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980;
                Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969,
                Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
            </p>

            <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight
                Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][27] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
                made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which
                proved to be successful.
            </p>
            <p>Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
                representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
                directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles
                from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[28] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet,
                Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her
                discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[28] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
                Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[28] His research and
                educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the
                government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[28] Kalam and Dr V S
                Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by
                the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of
                missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[29] R Venkatraman was instrumental in
                getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided
                Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[29] Kalam played a
                major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic
                missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised
                for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[29][30]</p>

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed
                by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March
                2021),[120][121] Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).[122] He was extremely close to
                his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums

            <p>Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.[123][124] He never owned a television, and
                was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.[125] His few personal possessions
                included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he
                left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.[126][127]</p>
